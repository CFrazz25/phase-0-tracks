<p>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?<br>
I learned about creating snippets and how to open up sublime pages side by side and even in groups of 4 to compare code to one another. I think as the coding gets more advanced and a lot more lengthy, creating snippets will become very handy to not have to code a lot of tedius stuff that you'll se in almost every page depending on the code and site. </p>

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? <br>
Understanding how to utilize all the structral elements seemed a little confusing until answering these questions actually, which made me do a little more research on common practice use with them to see more examples of how to use them and why. Also had a tough time with creating and saving snippets for a little bit, but guide was good to help. Looking forward to practicing creating more snippets soon, nice little quick way to get things going! </p>
