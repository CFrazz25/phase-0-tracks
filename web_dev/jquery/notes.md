How to tackle jquery knowledge in two hours:
For one, google. =) Pretty much the top 5 resources that come up for jquery I will check out. I will checkout codeacademy as well as codeschool to see if there's anything free I can tackle. I will also take a gander at W3 schools in the hopes that many of the jquery functions live in there, in otherwords, I'll be looking for a jquery cheatsheet. As I learn about this stuff, I will see if it makes sense to take some time to create a quick simple html and css file, perhaps taking some old code, and build off of it with jquery to interact with it a little bit. 


I ended up working with codeschool.com free lesson on intro to jquery for most of the time. I'm interested to see what codeacademy teaches differently from codeschool, so I still may check that out as well. I looked at w3 schools for a few as well, and I think it's easier to hop around on w3 schools to test things, but looking at codeschool first, helped me understand what some of the stuff in w3 schools meant. Practicing with a cheatsheet I found online was really helpful as well, to take so much and put them all together in one spot, making it seem so much simpler.
